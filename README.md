# Word Blaster

C++ challenge.

## Description

Build a word typing game that challenges the user to type over words as fast as possible.

Let the user login using a nickname. Also allow selection of difficulty.

Select random words from a file. Can be plain text file. Make sure that the difficulty influences the word selection from the file.

The score should be calculated based on the correctness of the user's typing and also the speed with which the user finishes each challenge. Calculate a score based on at least these parameters.

Allow the score to be saved to a file and displayed in a scoreboard.

Try to make the game a bit more appealing by using for example ascii art or other techniques for visualization inside the console.

Document the project with a decent `README.md` and UML class diagrams. Also explain new techniques or things you used to build the app.

Also include a `Makefile` so the project can be easily built using a single `make` command.
